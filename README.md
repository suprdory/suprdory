Welcome to my world of poorly-maintained, uncommented and undocumented  - but broadly functional - web projects. Here are a few highlights:

### [Bitmap Racer](https://bitmapracer.com) ([code](https://github.com/suprdory/bitmapRacer))
A play-in-your-browser top-down, 2D racing game with new challenge every day. Tracks derived from - but often bearing very little resemblance to - real-world locations. Surprisingly addictive, it has a very small but loyal player base. Cheers guys!


### [Spiralator](https://spiralator.com) ([code](https://github.com/suprdory/spiralator))
I made this to show off to my Mum after she bought me a spirograph for Christmas a couple of years ago. I'm 43 years old. The non-circular "arc-shapes" were a particular headache but I love them. To me it's still amazing to see the effect of changing the various parameters on the 'completed' shapes in real-time. There is also a "Gallery" open to abuse.


### [Harmonator](https://harmonata.com) ([code](https://github.com/suprdory/harmonator))

After I made Spiralator, this seemed like low-hanging fruit. I'd been fascinated by Harmonography since I got a little book about it ~20 years ago. As above, this digital version ruins some of the wonderful analogue magic of the original by making it too easy.

### [Midpoint](https://findthemidpoint.com) ([code](https://github.com/suprdory/midpointwebapp))

This is the one I should be retiring on. A genuinely brilliant idea (not mine JPB), that someone will sell to Google or Meta for millions one day. A little web app calling on a little web API that finds an equal travel-time meeting point for two or more people. Obviously my implementation is a clunky mess, it's the first and only "serious" web app I've made, but still... 

### [Grain](https://suprdory.com/grain) ([code](https://github.com/suprdory/grain))

My Gran used to have these art "toys" where sand of various colours (and densities or grain size) trapped in a pseudo 2D pane would fall through a mutable air-bubble barrier, hypnotically float down through a liquid medium and settle, creating beautiful semi geometric, semi organic-looking patterns. I made a very crude version of this.

### [TCvis](https://suprdory.com/tcvis) ([code](https://github.com/suprdory/tcvis))

I wanted a way to interactively explore a synthetic dataset created as part of my day job and came up with this. Pretty good except I can't for the life of me get it to zoom on a touch screen.
